- As a regular github user
- I want to be able to view my registration e-mail 
- So that I can refresh it in my mind

- On main page when you signed you can go to account setting, choose "You rofile" then will be shown your Profile infomation
- When you choose "Edit prifile"(located under user photo) you go to page, where you can see information(name, phone, e-mail etc) and change it, if you need it
